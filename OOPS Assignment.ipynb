    "1. Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the principle of bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, known as a class. It helps in hiding the internal implementation details and exposing only the necessary interfaces to interact with the class. This concept provides data protection and control over access to the data, promoting data integrity and security.\n",

    "2. Inheritance: Inheritance allows a class (called the subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (called the superclass or base class). This promotes code reusability and the creation of a hierarchy of classes. Subclasses can extend or override the attributes and methods of their superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Polymorphism: Polymorphism is the ability of different classes to be treated as instances of a common superclass. It allows objects of different classes to be used interchangeably if they implement a common interface or have a related hierarchy. Polymorphism enables flexibility and extensibility in code, as it allows for more generic and flexible programming.\n",

It involves defining a clear and concise interface for classes, where the underlying complexity is hidden from the user. Abstraction helps in managing code complexity and allows developers to focus on high-level functionality without getting bogged down in implementation details.\n",
